I found the enlarge and reduce as well Steganography parts to be challenging, I went to office hours to
get help on them.

The one thing that I disliked was the wording: some of it was confusing on what it was asking
or I didn't know what it wanted. Also Part 2: Steganography was a bit of a difficulty spike, but it was
not as bad once I understood but still a bit hard.



I spread out the project over three weeks, maybe spending 7 hours in total.


Steganography and Mondrain cpp/h are in framework
